# HDU-Univeristy-Website ðŸŽ“

## Project Structure
HDU (Hypothetical Dream University) Website is a beginner-friendly open-source project to challenge the community to create an aesthetically designed and responsive university website for a university called HDU. Essentially we would like to reimagine the [JSSSTU website](https://jssstuniv.in), built by the community. Both beginners in web development and designers are welcome to work together to make HDU's website look amazing. The website must contain all the pages that a general university website may have, you can have a look at [JSSSTU's website](https://jssstuniv.in) for an idea of this.
